# DecsLoginSecurity2
A simple, lightweight and effective login security plugin for Minecraft

This was used for the server I worked on called [The Pit](https://github.com/dec4234/PitCore3/) because it was an offline mode server.

Without any sort of login security plugin such as this one, anyone could login as any user because there was no authentication.
